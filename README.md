50,000 Meows with JavaScript
============

I thought it would be fun to convert [hugovk's](https://github.com/hugovk/meow.py) meow.py to JavaScript.

Demo can be viewed [here](http://timtate.github.io/meow.js/)

Usage
-----
    import common.js, and meow.js at the least. there's also nope.js that converts to "no" instead of meow.
    then simply meowify(inputText) or nopify(inputText)

Output
------

Here's the above rule put through meowify:

>     meeeow meooow.me, mew meow.me me mew meoow. meoow'm meow meow.me meow meeeooow me "me" meeeeew me meow.
    meow meeeew meeeeow(meeeeOoow) me meeoow(meeooOoow)
